# Overview
This project focuses on preparing and analyzing NYC Taxi trip data before and after the COVID-19 pandemic. The goal is to explore data patterns, clean the dataset, perform exploratory data analysis (EDA), and identify key features that impact trip fares. Additionally, we compare pre-pandemic (January 2020) vs. post-pandemic (March 2020 onward) trends to understand the "new normal" in the industry.

# Key Objectives
Data Preprocessing:
Handle missing, null, and NaN values.
Identify and treat outliers.
Ensure all data is numeric for model compatibility.
Convert categorical variables into numerical representations.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):

Classic EDA: Use Pandas & NumPy for statistical insights.

TFDV Approach: Utilize TensorFlow Data Validation (TFDV) for graphical statistics and insights.

Identify dependencies and correlations between features.

Feature Importance analysis to determine the most influential variables affecting trip fare.

Time-Window Consideration:
Compare NYC Taxi data before (January 2020) and after (March 2020 onward) the pandemic.

Analyze shifts in trip frequency, fare structure, and other key metrics.

# Technologies & Libraries Used
Data Processing: Pandas, NumPy

Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn

TFDV Analysis: TensorFlow Data Validation, Apache Beam

Feature Engineering & Selection: Scikit-learn

# Results & Insights
The impact of COVID-19 on NYC Taxi trip frequency and revenue.

Key features affecting trip fares (distance, passenger count, time of day, etc.).

Visual comparisons between pre- and post-pandemic data.
